## Hi!

This is a sample project for a travel app using React Native Expo with TypeScript and fetching data from Google API.

### Prerequisites

App is created with [REACT NATIVE](https://reactjs.org/) styled with [TAILWIND CSS](https://mui.com/). app/)

It works nice on IoS and Android mobiles

## Thanks !
