## Hi!

This is a sample project for a travel app using React Native Expo with TypeScript and fetching data from Google API.

### Prerequisites

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API Key as `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
4. Change headers of `X-RapidAPI-Key` inside api/index.js to Your api key - from [here](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/)
5. Start the development server: `yarn start`
6. Select runtime device (IOS or ANDROID)

If u have Expo account just simply scan QR code from top documentation and run on Your device.
